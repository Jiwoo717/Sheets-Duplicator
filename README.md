# Google AppScript Budget Automation

This repository contains JavaScript code I designed to run on Google's AppScript platform. Its purpose is to automate the process of duplicating and renaming Google Sheets to facilitate monthly budgeting. The codebase is split into two main parts:
  1. Script for duplicating Google Sheets and renaming them.
  2. A time-based trigger that runs monthly, preparing your budget sheets for the upcoming month.

## üöÄ Features

- **Sheet Duplication**: Duplicates a template budget sheet automatically.
- **Sheet Renaming**: Renames the duplicated sheet with the appropriate month and year.
- **Monthly Trigger**: So I ensure my next month's budget sheet is always prepared.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Set Up

1. **Google AppScript Introduction**:
   If you're unfamiliar with Google AppScript, it's recommended to start with [Google's official documentation](https://developers.google.com/apps-script).

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [YOUR REPO URL HERE]

3. **Run the Appscript Extension**
   Have your sheet ready and run the script.

4. **Test it and Tinker it**
   Run the code for current date and specified time to ensure the functionality of the duplicator.
